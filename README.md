# Memory Game

My own javascript game with desktop and phone support. <br>
Your goal is to match a card to its right sibling. When all cards are turned up and correct you win. If you turn up two cards and they dont match they will turn back and you have to remember what it was for your next move. <br><br>
Should be easy to add your own content if wanted as long as you have some JS knowledge. Using some Jquery in code. <br>
For more info about modifying check the file "modifyGame.md". <br>
